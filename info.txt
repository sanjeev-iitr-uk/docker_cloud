Summary
--------

in this branch we will create a react app using create-react-app. then we will perform these steps
1- create a travis.yml
2- this travis.yml will first create an image using Dockerfile.dev and then run this image with command npm run test
3- after sucessful test, it will deploy the whole code on elastic beanstalk
4- now elastic beanstalk will read Dockerfile and build an image
5- 

Travis Config (.travis.yml)
