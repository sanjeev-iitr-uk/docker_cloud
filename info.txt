docker-compose is a cli tool same like docker cli. but docker-compose allows us write configurations and commands in files
or say it allows us to automate commands, so you can avoid typing repetative commands in docker cli.
aslo docker-compose allows us to wrtite multiple services(container) configuration in a single file and and these services
can connect with each other without any extra configuration.



in this branch we are creating two services (containers)
1- NodeApp
2- Redis server

NodeApp will stores number of visites on app. everytime it will increase counter in redis. thats all.


docker-compose commands

1- docker-compose up 
use this command to run all the containers (services) inside docker-compose file

2- docker-compose up --build
use this command to build and run all the services written in docker-compose file

3- docker-compose down 
use this command to stop all service(container)

4- docker-compose up -d 
-d flag is used to run services in background same like docker run -d <container id>

5- docker_compose ps 
use this command to get all runing containers
