// L11 - deployment objects


Summary
--------

if you want to update the image in existing pod object. we can just update the image in object file use command to feed it to cluster via master node

kubectl apply -f <your_updated file name>
master will identify if there is already any object of type pod and with same label is runing inside cluster.
it will update that pos, otherwise it will create a new pod

using the above way to update objects has limited functionality like it can only update images no other changes in
file are allowed. so for that there is other file type called deployments. we can use deployments for both prod and dev.
