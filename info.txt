// L6 - A Multicontainer App Prod Version


Summary
--------

In this branch we will discuss about why we use kubernetes and its architecture. we will also deploy multiclient app in docker pod.


1- Why we use kubernetes

kubernetes allows us a platform to manage multiple containers and scale when needed. its a container archectration


2- Architecture

in this branch we will use 2 tools kubernetes 
A- minikube - this tool is use for creating a kubernetes clust in local computer
B- kubectl - this tool allows us to manage kubernetes cluster 

so, kubernetes is cluster of nodes(vm). each can have multiple pods and each pod can have multiple containers runing inside. generally a pod contain dependent or tightly coupled containers.  apart from nodes each cluster has a master node, this node manages all the nodes(this master takes decision which pod is runing on which node). 

Object - in kubernetes we create objects (pod, service, etc) using configuration files.
------
a file of type pod is used to create pod inside node via master node
commands 

kubectl apply -f mypod.yml
this command launch a pod with container image written inside this file
kubectl get pods
list out all runing pods
kubectl get services
list out all services runing 


services
-------
services files are used to setup networking between pods
