// Basic Commands

1- docker run <imageName> <Default Command>

Ex - docker run busybox ls 
so this command will use busybox image <download from docker server> and create a container out of that.
now it will start this container and run ls command inside that conatiner.

so basically run command is nothing but create + start 
Ex- docker create <imageName>
this command will create a container out of this image 
Ex - docker start  -a <containerId>
-a flag is for attach your terminal for output

2- docker ps
this command will list out all running containers

3- docker ps --all 
this command will list out all  stopped  containers

4- docker system prune
this command will delete all stoped containers and their resources

5- docker log <containerId>
this will log data of exited container

6- docker stop <containerId>
this command will stop the container gracefully (remove attached resources also so it will take few seconds to complate)

7- docker kill <containerId> 
this command will kill the container immidiately (don't care about deattaching resources)

8- docker exec -it <containerId> <default Command>
using this command you can enter in runing container. -i flag will allow to interact from your local terminal to 
process runing inside your container. and -t flag allows you to output well formated messages.
